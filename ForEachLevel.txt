An empty game object (PlayerSpawnTransform) has to be added with the same coords as the players spawn point. This is because if the player dies or presses 'R', they should go back to spawn
This GameObject has to be linked in 2 places:
FPP Player > ShortcutScript
FPP Player > CollisionDetector

'Kill when y lesser than' should be set in Player > CollisionDetector to the height 'y' under which the player should die
